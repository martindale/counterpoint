Brand Guidelines
================

Counterpoint's brand is intended to combine elements of both programming and 
anarchist symbolism. The XML self-closing tag was used as a starting point, 
due to the visual nature of the `/` character as a separator between two points 
(ala "counterpoint").

This basic symbol is stylized to resemble the various bisected flags used by 
different variations of anarchist philosophy. See 
[Anarchist Symbolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_symbolism) for 
meanings of various color combinations.

There are at least 3 ways that the brand should be represented based on the 
media used. The standard logo (or "full" logo), the standalone icon, and of 
course a plain text representation.

Standard (Free Form)
--------------------

The standard version of the logo includes the free floating logo (no enclosure) 
and "counterpoint" as text beneath. The brand font is "I pixel u" and is 
included in this repository.

Due to the nature of the symbolism (and perhaps the nature of Counterpoint 
itself), the colors can and should be changed to suit the desire and needs of 
it's particular media and the individual or group incorporating it. However, 
for consistency, the top section of the logo (`</`) color should match the 
color of "counter" and the bottom section of the logo (`/>`) color should match 
the color of "point".

### Example

Icon Only (Encircled)
---------------------

For cases where you want to minimize the amount of negative space or need to 
fit the logo within a square, you may want to use the text-less encircled icon. 
This version extends the length of the two `/` sections and subtracts the logo 
from a circle background. This format is ideal for icons, stickers, etc (RFID 
tokens, tattoos, vehicle rims? lawl).

The color guidelines for this format are not relevent since there is no text to 
match, so just make it excellent!

### Example

Plain Text
----------

The Counterpoint logo may also be represented as plaintext for those who are
