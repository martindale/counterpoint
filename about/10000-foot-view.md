Counterpoint is a free non-profit hackerspace facilitating the exploration of 
4 primary areas: Computer Hacking, Multimedia Hacking, UAV Hacking, and Art 
Hacking. The purpose of this writing is to provide a high-level overview of our 
effort to spark the growth of a community dedicated to free learning and open 
access to information and resources.

## Mission Statement

Counterpoint's mission is to provide a safe community environment for learning 
new things and stimulating creative minds, both young and old. To foster a 
community that values sharing knowledge over profit. To provide tools to those 
who do not have them. To prove that when we work with each other instead of for 
each other, we can accomplish great things.

We believe that the only prerequisite to learning is desire and that access to 
resources and information should be free. As such, Counterpoint will always be 
free and open to anyone who wishes to participate.

## (Non)-Governance

We have chosen to model decision making after the anarchist "do-cratic" process 
implemented by Noisebridge in San Fransisco. If you want to see something 
happen at Counterpoint, then start doing it. The guiding principle is only to 
"be excellent to each other".

If you are unsure about the excellence of something, simply ask another member 
what they think! No one is in charge at Counterpoint because no one needs to 
be. When great people work together for a common altruistic goal, leaders can 
only serve to disrupt.

Decisions are made through member consensus, meaning only if everyone agrees 
that something is excellent. 

## Space Requirements

Knowing the types of hackers that will inhabit Counterpoint, we can determine 
what sort of space and resources they will need. While initially the members 
of Counterpoint will provide classes and workshops in existing public venues, 
the goal is to build a community large enough to have a space of it's own.

We have created a likely list of desired areas, organized by the category of 
hackers.

### Common Classroom

* Medium-sized open space
* Tables and seating for workshops and classes
* Projector or large TV for presentations

### Computer Hacking

* Separate medium-sized room with door for sound dampening
* Shared workspaces with high speed internet connection
* Computer parts for repairing and building
* Shared computers for classes and public use
* Soldering tools and materials

### Multimedia Hacking

* Small sound-proof recording bay
* Small room with window to recording bay
* Public use microphones, cameras, and lights
* Shared computer for capture and editing

### UAV Hacking

* Large work table for drone assembly and repair
* Outdoor open area for test flights
* Spare parts and tools for repairing and building

### Art Hacking

* Medium-sized room for painting, drawing, claywork
* Art supplies (paint, pencils, clay, canvas, paper, knives)
* Kiln for pottery hacking
* Tables for group seating for classes
* Showcase area for displaying community pieces

## Sustainability and Income

Since Counterpoint is a non-profit organization, we will rely on donations from 
sponsors and community members in the form of both capital and materials. At no 
point in time will Counterpoint host events that are exclusive, requiring a 
donation to participate. This means that attending classes and workshops will 
always be free to anyone who wishes to participate.
 
However, knowing that this can prove difficult, we have outlined some possible 
strategies for keeping Counterpoint up and running.

### Membership Dues

While Counterpoint will *always* be available to *anyone* at no cost, frequent 
members may subscribe to a monthly or annual membership. Membership should be 
affordable and provide reasonable benefits to those who choose to support the 
space in this way. Some options are:

* 24/7 access
* Commercial use of space (hacking for profit)
* Room reservation (multimedia room, etc)
* Stake in development of the space (participation in consensus)

### Events and Sponsorships

Events keep a community engaged and attract new members to the space. Events 
that attract members may also attract corporate sponsors. Some ideas for 
events that could bring in sponsorships:

* Software Hackathon
* Amateur Film Festival
* Community Art Show
* UAV Air Show Contest
* Weekly Free Classes

### Community Shop

It is safe to assume that a hackerspace filled with hackers will yield tangible 
items. These items such as pottery, art pieces, wearables, multimedia, and 
anything else created by members could be sold consignment style in the space 
itself. This would be done for a reasonable commission consistent with the 
amount of materials used from the space to produce such goods and an optional 
additional commission chosen by the seller as a donation to the space.

### Workshops and Classes

Fostering learning and exploration is a primary tenet of Counterpoint and as 
such, hosting workshops and classes by members or industry professionals is a 
very important part of our mission. These events would be free and open for 
anyone to participate, thus attracting membership. Sponsorship is a likely 
scenario for these events, especially if they are delivered by local companies. 
These might range from some of the following:

* Using a software product developed by Company X
* Building UAVs with products manufactured by Company Y
* Learning to edit multimedia with tools provided by Company Z

In addition, we would encourage members to host their own workshops without 
this type of corporate sponsorship, like:

* Information security for kids
* Art and pottery classes for all ages
* Using free software frameworks to build X
* Multimedia editing tips and tricks

### Youth Programs

We believe that all children are great hackers, due to their innate desire to 
explore and learn. Counterpoint should provide an environment where these 
desires can be cultivated and allowed to grow outside of the stifling nature of 
public education. While kids of all ages are welcome at Counterpoint *anytime*, 
we could provide youth-centric programs, such as a summer camp. We could 
develop curriculum for the different types of hacking for which the space 
provides resource and let participating kids choose a path for a week long 
workshop.

### Art Auctions

Members who participate in the art hacking programs can choose to donate their 
work to Counterpoint for silent auction. This doesn't have to be limited to art 
hacking either: drones, bots, wearables, or anything made in the space may be 
donated for this purpose.

### Space Rental

While not a primary or even desired source of income, a space's most valuable 
offering, outside of the people who inhabit it, is the space itself. Renting 
our common space to other groups is always an option if membership falls short.
