Meeting Minutes
===============

Minutes for every meeting are stored and tracked here. If you are taking notes, 
you are awesome! Click "Add File Here" at the top of the directory tree and 
start writing. Please copy the format of previous minutes and use the same 
naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

Minutes must be recorded using 
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) format.
