Welcome to the Counterpoint Hackerspace repository. Here we store and track 
everything from meeting minutes and legal documents. All content in this 
repository is in the public domain (see `LICENSE`). The hope is that others 
who wish to start a hackerspace can (literally) fork Counterpoint by forking 
this repository and modify to their needs.

## Adding Content

If you are a "collaborator" for this repository and you need to add a document, 
you can do so through the GitHub website. Please author the file using 
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and give it a 
file extension of `.md` so that GitHub will render it all pretty, like this.

If you are not a "collaborator" you can fork this repostitory and send a pull 
request with your changes. You can also request to be a collaborator, of 
course. Just email `gordonhall@openmailbox.org` and ask nicely.
